- I created a full **interactive dashboard in Excel** to track my sales performance, customer locations, and product popularity. 
- The dashboard has filters that let you explore by **month** and **location**, which makes it so much easier to spot trends and understand what‚Äôs driving sales.

## Some cool insights I found:
- **Kampala and Mukono** are my top customer locations (shoutout to my customers there!), with Kampala alone bringing in over UGX 49 million in sales! On the other hand, places like **Jinja** and **Kabale** could use some love, so I‚Äôll be planning some marketing efforts to reach more people there.
  
- The busiest months were **May, March, and December**.
- December makes sense with the holiday season, but May was a bit of a surprise! This kind of info is gold for planning my stock and promotions.

- My top-selling rings were the **Rose Gold Ring** and **Gold Plated Ring**
- so those are definitely here to stay! Meanwhile, I‚Äôve learned which styles might need a refresh or more visibility.

- This dashboard has actually been a huge help in setting me up for success in 2024, and I‚Äôm well on my way to meeting my goal of increasing profits by 20%.
- It‚Äôs crazy how much you can learn from diving into the data.

If you‚Äôre into data or thinking of using insights like these to grow your own business, let‚Äôs connect!
